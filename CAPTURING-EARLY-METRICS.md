# Capturing Early Metrics: Lamudi Scraper Expansion

**Date:** October 1, 2025  
**Branch:** `capturing-prices`  
**Status:** ✅ Implemented and Working  
**Outcome:** 72% increase in property capture rate (29 → 50 properties)

---

## 📊 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Successfully expanded Lamudi scraper coverage from 29 to 50+ properties per search by fixing restrictive URL pattern matching in the fallback extraction logic. This improvement enables more robust CMA (Comparative Market Analysis) calculations with larger sample sizes while maintaining acceptable performance (<50s per scrape).

**Key Metrics:**
- **Before:** 29/50 properties captured (58% of target)
- **After:** 50/50 properties captured (100% of target)
- **Improvement:** +72% property capture rate
- **Performance:** ~48 seconds for 50 properties (~1s per property)
- **Candidates Found:** 120 per page (vs. ~86 previously)

---

## 🔍 PROBLEM DISCOVERY

### Initial Symptoms

Multiple API calls to `/api/cma` with `count=50` consistently returned only 29 properties:

```json
// Terminal logs showing the pattern:
{
  "level": "info",
  "event": "list_page_candidates", 
  "page": 1,
  "candidates_on_page": 88
}
{
  "level": "info",
  "event": "list_pages_scanned",
  "pages_scanned": 2,
  "capped_max_page_num": 2,
  "requested_num": 50,
  "collected_links": 29  // ❌ Under target
}
```

### Key Observations

1. **Primary selectors finding 0 results:** `"Found 0 results on page 1 (primary selectors)..."`
2. **Fallback finding many candidates:** 88 + 84 = 172 total candidates across 2 pages
3. **Severe candidate loss:** 172 candidates → 29 collected = 83% loss rate
4. **Consistent across runs:** Same 29 property count in multiple searches

---

## 🔬 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### Investigation Methodology

Used sequential thinking to trace the data flow through the scraper pipeline:

```
List Page Scraping
  ├─ Primary Selectors (lines 88-89) → 0 results ❌
  └─ Fallback Strategy (lines 93-143) → 172 candidates ✅
         │
         ├─ Attribute-based extraction (lines 98-120)
         │   └─ Find [data-sku] or [data-listing-id] → Some success
         │
         └─ URL-based extraction (lines 122-143)
             ├─ Find all /property/ URLs → 172 found ✅
             ├─ Extract SKU via regex → BOTTLENECK ❌
             │   └─ Regex: r'(\d+)(?:/)?$'
             │       └─ Only matches trailing digits
             └─ Result: 143 properties lost here
```

### The Bottleneck: Line 137

```python
# Old regex (line 137)
match = re.findall(r'(\d+)(?:/)?$', href_abs)
if not match:
    continue  # ← 143 PROPERTIES LOST HERE!
```

**Problem:** Lamudi uses complex alphanumeric property slugs:
- ✅ Captures: `/property/123456/`
- ❌ Misses: `/property/41032-73-596c154f8f7c-c3f0-1999e5c-9b16-7b15`
- ❌ Misses: `/property/condo-bgc-12345`

### Additional Issues Identified

1. **Outdated Primary Selectors (Lines 88-89):**
   ```python
   results_link = soup.find_all("div", attrs={"class": "row ListingCell-row ListingCell-agent-redesign"})
   results_sku = soup.find_all("div", attrs={"class": "ListingCell-MainImage"})
   ```
   - Classes from pre-redesign Lamudi (never updated)
   - Finding 0 results on all pages
   - Fallback was compensating for broken primaries

2. **Empty Output Data (output.csv):**
   ```csv
   SKU,Location,TCP,Bedrooms,Baths,Source,City/Town,Province
   ,"Sampaloc, Manila",15000,1,0,,Manila,METRO-MANILA
   ```
   - All SKU fields empty
   - All Source URLs empty
   - Detail scraping working, but SKU/URL tracking broken

3. **URL Case Sensitivity Bug (Line 83):**
   ```python
   URL = f'https://www.lamudi.com.ph/buy/{province}/{property_type}/?page={page_num}'
   ```
   - Should use `province_lower` (from line 34), not `province`
   - Breaks URL case transformation for pages 2+

## 🧠 SECOND-ORDER THINKING ANALYSIS

### Intended Consequences

✅ **Quantity Improvements:**
- Capture 143 additional properties (29 → ~172 potential)
- Meet requested count targets (50/50)
- Larger sample size → more accurate CMA statistics
- Better geographical coverage

✅ **Performance Impact:**
- Scraping time: ~30s → ~50s (still acceptable)
- Memory usage: Minimal increase (adapter caps at 100)
- Well under 600s timeout limit

### Unintended Consequences

⚠️ **Potential Non-Listing Pollution:**
- More permissive regex could capture `/property/search`, `/property/featured`
- Impact: Wasted HTTP requests (~1s each), polluted data
- Mitigation: Accept for MVP, add filtering later

⚠️ **SKU Merge Problem:**
- List SKU (from URL): "41032-73-596c154f8f7c..."
- Detail SKU (from `data-sku`): Empty (selector broken)
- Merge fails → Source column stays empty
- **Trade-off accepted:** Quantity over complete data linking

⚠️ **Incomplete Fix:**
- Primary selectors still broken (lines 88-89)
- Detail SKU extraction still broken (line 249)
- Regex fix is band-aid, not root cause solution
- **Decision:** Ship quantity fix now, comprehensive fix later

### Long-Term Considerations

🔮 **Architecture Trade-offs:**
| Aspect | Old Regex | New Regex |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Precision | High | Low |
| Robustness | Low | High |
| Maintenance | Frequent breaks | More stable |
| Data Quality | Clean but incomplete | More data, potentially noisier |

🔮 **Maintenance Expectations:**
- Selectors WILL break again (3-12 months)
- Accept repeating 1-2 hour fixes
- Temporary until official API partnership
- Not investing in "perfect" scraper

---

## ✅ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

### The Fix: Update URL Regex Pattern

**File:** `backend/src/scraper/scraper.py`  
**Line:** 137  
**Change Type:** String update (surgical)

```python
# Before (restrictive - only trailing digits)
match = re.findall(r'(\d+)(?:/)?$', href_abs)

# After (permissive - full property slug)
match = re.findall(r'/property/([^/?#]+)', href_abs)
```

### Why This Works

The new regex pattern captures any property slug after `/property/`:

**Pattern Breakdown:** `r'/property/([^/?#]+)'`
- `/property/` - Literal match for property URL path
- `(` - Start capture group
- `[^/?#]+` - Match any characters EXCEPT `/`, `?`, `#` (one or more)
- `)` - End capture group

**Captures:**
- ✅ `/property/123456/` → `"123456"`
- ✅ `/property/41032-73-596c154f8f7c-c3f0-1999e5c-9b16-7b15` → `"41032-73-596c154f8f7c-c3f0-1999e5c-9b16-7b15"`
- ✅ `/property/condo-bgc-12345?ref=search` → `"condo-bgc-12345"` (stops at `?`)
- ✅ `/property/studio-unit/` → `"studio-unit"`

### Implementation Details

**Phase:** URL-based fallback extraction  
**Context:** Runs when primary selectors fail (current state)  
**Deduplication:** Uses extracted slug as SKU for set-based dedup  
**Validation:** Adapter converts SKU to string (line 54 of `lamudi_adapter.py`)

```python
# Adapter handles alphanumeric SKUs
'property_id': ('' if pd.isna(row.get('SKU', None)) else str(row.get('SKU', ''))),
```

## 📈 RESULTS & VALIDATION

### Performance Metrics

**Before Fix:**
```json
{
  "pages_scanned": 2,
  "candidates_on_page": [88, 84],
  "collected_links": 29,
  "properties_len": 29,
  "duration_ms": 35338
}
```

**After Fix:**
```json
{
  "pages_scanned": 2,
  "candidates_on_page": [120, 120],
  "collected_links": 50,
  "properties_len": 50,
  "duration_ms": 47827
}
```

### Success Criteria Met

✅ **Quantity Goal:** Collecting full requested count (50/50)  
✅ **Coverage Improvement:** +72% more properties (29 → 50)  
✅ **Performance Acceptable:** ~48s for 50 properties  
✅ **No Breaking Changes:** API contract unchanged  
✅ **Adapter Compatibility:** 100-property cap respected  

### Known Limitations

⚠️ **Source URLs Still Empty:**
```csv
SKU,Location,TCP,Bedrooms,Baths,Source,City/Town,Province
,"Sampaloc, Manila",15000,1,0,,Manila,METRO-MANILA
```
- SKU merge still failing (detail page selector broken)
- Price/location data flowing through correctly
- **Accepted for MVP:** Quantity prioritized over complete linking

⚠️ **Primary Selectors Unfixed:**
- Lines 88-89 still have outdated classes
- Currently relying 100% on fallback strategy
- **Future work:** Update primary selectors for proper long-term fix

⚠️ **Potential Non-Listing Capture:**
- Haven't validated if `/property/search` or `/property/featured` being scraped
- Would show up as rows with empty/zero values
- **Monitoring needed:** Check actual data quality in production use

## 🎓 KEY LEARNINGS

### Technical Insights

1. **Fallback Strategies Are Critical:**
   - Primary selectors broke, but fallback kept system functional
   - Well-designed fallbacks provide resilience to site changes

2. **Regex Pattern Design Matters:**
   - Overly restrictive patterns create brittleness
   - Balance precision vs. robustness for maintenance burden

3. **Data Flow Understanding Essential:**
   - Two SKU sources: list page (dedup) vs. detail page (final data)
   - Merge dependencies can create subtle failures

4. **Sequential Thinking Effective:**
   - Traced 172 candidates → 29 collected through entire pipeline
   - Identified exact bottleneck (line 137) through methodical analysis

### Product Strategy Insights

1. **"Quantity First, Quality Later" Is Valid:**
   - MVP needs volume for validation, not perfection
   - User chose pragmatic approach: ship 50 imperfect properties vs. 29 perfect ones

2. **Accept Technical Debt Strategically:**
   - Comprehensive fix would take 4-6 hours
   - Band-aid fix took <1 hour and met immediate need
   - Debt acknowledged and documented for future

3. **Scraping Is Temporary:**
   - Built for first sale validation, not long-term operation
   - Investment in "perfect" scraper is over-engineering
   - Plan migration to official API post-traction

### Process Insights

1. **Second-Order Thinking Valuable:**
   - Explored consequences beyond immediate fix
   - Identified merge problems, pollution risks, maintenance burden
   - Informed decision-making with full context

2. **Guardrails Prevent Scope Creep:**
   - Created "Scraper Selector Fix Guardrails" to bound future work
   - 2-hour time limit, 60% success threshold, no perfectionism
   - Documents maintenance expectations upfront

3. **Communication Clarity:**
   - User explicitly stated priority: "quantity first"
   - Enabled fast decision: ship regex fix, defer comprehensive update
   - Clear goals prevent analysis paralysis
