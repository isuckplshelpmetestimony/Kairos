# Backend-Frontend Integration Report

## Project Context
- **Platform:** Real estate CMA (Comparative Market Analysis)
- **Tech Stack:** React + Vite + Flask + Python scraper
- **Data Source:** Lamudi (Philippine property listings)
- **Goal:** Demo-ready MVP for investor validation

## Objective Achieved
Successfully implemented frontend-to-backend integration for a real estate analysis platform, connecting React frontend to Flask backend with Lamudi scraper.

## Key Technical Challenges & Solutions

### 1. Port Conflict Resolution
**Problem:** Both frontend (Vite) and backend (Flask) tried to use port 3000
**Solution:** Run Flask on 3000, Vite on 3001 during development
**Lesson:** Always check for port conflicts before debugging API issues

### 2. PSGC Code Mismatch
**Problem:** Frontend sent city-level PSGC codes (1375, 1374, 1378) but backend only accepted region-level (1376 for NCR)
**Solution:** Updated all Metro Manila addresses in frontend mock data to use "1376"
**Lesson:** Data validation issues often manifest as 400 errors - check data format alignment between frontend/backend

### 3. Environment Configuration
**Problem:** Frontend couldn't connect to backend due to wrong API URL
**Solution:** Created `.env` file with `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000`
**Lesson:** Environment variables must be updated when changing server ports

## Architecture Decisions Made

### Development Setup
- **Frontend:** Vite dev server on port 3001
- **Backend:** Flask API server on port 3000
- **Communication:** Frontend calls `localhost:3000/api/cma`

### Production Path
- **Single Server Option:** Flask serves both static files and API routes
- **Deployment:** render.yaml configured for both services

## Critical Implementation Details

### Backend (Flask)
```python
# Key endpoints implemented:
GET /health → {"status": "ok"}
POST /api/cma → Accepts {psgc_province_code, property_type, count}
# Threading lock prevents concurrent scrapes
# Returns 409 "busy" if scraper running
```

### Frontend (React)
```tsx
// Key state management:
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
const [cma, setCma] = useState<CMAResult | null>(null);
const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);
```

### Data Flow
1. User selects address → PSGC code extracted
2. Frontend POSTs to `/api/cma` with PSGC code
3. Backend validates PSGC → maps to Lamudi province
4. Scraper runs → CSV output → Stats computed
5. JSON response with properties + stats

## Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Debugging Order
❌ **Wrong:** Assume API issues are complex backend problems
✅ **Right:** Check basic connectivity first (ports, URLs, environment)

### 2. Data Validation
❌ **Wrong:** Assume frontend/backend data formats match
✅ **Right:** Verify data structure alignment between services

### 3. Development vs Production
❌ **Wrong:** Over-engineer development setup
✅ **Right:** Keep development simple, optimize for production separately

### 4. Error Handling Patterns
❌ **Wrong:** Generic "Failed to fetch" messages
✅ **Right:** Specific error states (409 busy, 400 validation, 500 server)
✅ **Better:** User-friendly messages ("Scraper busy, try again in 5 minutes")

## Success Metrics
- ✅ Frontend-backend communication working
- ✅ API calls returning 200 responses
- ✅ Loading states and error handling implemented
- ✅ End-to-end smoke test successful
- ✅ 12/13 checklist items completed

## Implementation Checklist Status

### ✅ Completed (12/13)
1. ✅ Backend folder and scraper
2. ✅ PSGC mapper implementation
3. ✅ Flask app with endpoints
4. ✅ Serialization lock for scrapes
5. ✅ CORS and dependencies
6. ✅ Local testing
7. ✅ Frontend wiring to backend
8. ✅ Environment configuration
9. ✅ render.yaml deployment config
11. ✅ Frontend UX polish
12. ✅ Legal notice in README
13. ✅ End-to-end smoke test

### ❌ Remaining (1/13)
10. ❌ UptimeRobot monitor (optional - can be skipped until deployment)

## Next Steps Identified
- Deploy to Render using render.yaml
- Implement single-server solution for production
- Add UptimeRobot monitoring (optional)

## Key Learnings
1. **Simple debugging first:** Check ports, URLs, environment variables
2. **Data format alignment:** Ensure frontend/backend speak same language
3. **Progressive complexity:** Start with working solution, optimize later
4. **User experience:** Loading states and clear error messages are essential
5. **Documentation:** Legal notices and clear README prevent confusion

## Files Created/Modified

### Backend Files
- `backend/app.py` - Flask application with API endpoints
- `backend/psgc_mapper.py` - PSGC to Lamudi province mapping
- `backend/requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `backend/lamudi_scraper.py` - Property scraper
- `backend/data/` - CSV output directory

### Frontend Files
- `Kairos/src/App.tsx` - Added CMA generation functionality
- `Kairos/src/hooks/useAddressSearch.ts` - Fixed PSGC codes
- `Kairos/.env` - Environment configuration
- `Kairos/README.md` - Added legal notice

### Deployment Files
- `render.yaml` - Render deployment configuration

## Git Commit History
- **Commit:** `7124b11 - lamudi scraper somewhat working but in the main git branch`
- **Status:** Successfully pushed to main branch

## Conclusion
This integration successfully demonstrates a lean, working frontend-backend architecture that can be deployed and scaled. The systematic approach to debugging (check connectivity first, then data formats) proved crucial for rapid problem resolution.

The solution prioritizes simplicity and maintainability while providing a solid foundation for future enhancements and production deployment.
