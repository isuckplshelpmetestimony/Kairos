# CAROUSELL SCRAPER INTEGRATION ANALYSIS

**Created:** October 1, 2025  
**Context:** Exploration of adding Carousell.ph as a second data source to Kairos CMA tool  
**Status:** NOT RECOMMENDED for immediate implementation  
**Recommendation:** Demo Lamudi first, validate demand, then reconsider

---

## üìå EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**The Question:** Should we integrate Carousell.ph property scraper alongside Lamudi?

**The Answer:** Not yet. Demo with Lamudi alone first, then build based on user feedback.

**Why:**
- Violates your validation-first principles (PIVOTS-MADE.md)
- 390 lines of speculative code with 30-40% success chance
- Unknown user demand
- Would delay Week 3 demo timeline
- Premature optimization before market validation

**What to Do Instead:**
1. Demo Lamudi to 3 companies (Week 3)
2. Ask users: "Would more data sources help? Which ones?"
3. Build Carousell ONLY if users explicitly request it
4. Stay lean, stay validated

---

## üé¨ CONVERSATION JOURNEY

### Act 1: Understanding Lamudi Integration

**Topic:** How the Lamudi scraper was integrated

**Key Findings:**
- **Architecture:** 4 layers (Scraper ‚Üí Adapter ‚Üí API ‚Üí Frontend)
- **Tech stack:** requests + BeautifulSoup (no Selenium)
- **Pattern:** Function-based scraper ‚Üí adapter normalization ‚Üí Flask API
- **Deployment:** Render free tier, ~50MB footprint
- **Timeline:** 3 weeks to build
- **Cost:** $0
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Working in production

**Data Flow:**
```
User Address Input
  ‚Üì (PSGC code extraction)
Frontend POST /api/cma
  ‚Üì (PSGC ‚Üí province mapping)
Lamudi Scraper (requests + BeautifulSoup)
  ‚Üì (list pages + detail pages)
Adapter Normalization
  ‚Üì (canonical format)
Stats Calculation
  ‚Üì (avg, median, min, max)
JSON Response ‚Üí Frontend Display
```

---

### Act 2: Initial Carousell Rejection

**Question:** "Can we integrate the Carousell scraper?"

**Initial Response:** ‚ùå **HELL NO**

**Reasoning:**
- Assumed Carousell = consumer goods marketplace (baby chairs, electronics)
- Wrong domain (not real estate)
- Wrong tech stack (Selenium vs requests)
- Wrong country (Singapore vs Philippines)
- Would dilute brand (CMA tool scraping baby chairs?)
- Violates lean MVP principles

**Verdict:** "Strategic mistake that adds technical debt"

---

### Act 3: The Reversal

**What Changed:** User provided screenshots showing Carousell.ph has dedicated Property section

**New Evidence:**
- ‚úÖ Apartments & Condos category
- ‚úÖ House and Lot category  
- ‚úÖ Commercial properties
- ‚úÖ Same cities as target market (Quezon City, Makati, BGC, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Legitimate real estate marketplace, not just consumer goods

**Revised Position:** ‚úÖ **"I was completely wrong!"**

**Potential Value:**
- Captures FSBO (For Sale By Owner) market
- Properties potentially 5-10% below agent-listed prices
- More comprehensive market coverage
- Shows full market spectrum (not just premium listings)
- Individual sellers + motivated sales

**But Still Recommended:** Demo Lamudi first, add Carousell after validation

---

### Act 4: Complexity & Technical Debt Analysis

**Question:** "Would this be simple or complex? How much technical debt?"

**Complexity Assessment:**

| Aspect | Rating | Details |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **Overall Complexity** | MODERATE-HIGH | Assumed Selenium required |
| **Time Estimate** | 5-6 days | Full implementation |
| **Technical Debt** | MEDIUM-HIGH | ~20 hours/year maintenance |
| **New Code** | 420+ lines | Scraper + adapter + integration |
| **Dependencies** | Selenium + Chrome | Heavy additions |
| **Deployment** | Complex | ChromeDriver, buildPacks |
| **Memory Usage** | 200-250MB | vs 50MB for requests |

**Key Issues Identified:**

1. **Selenium Fragility**
   - Breaks with Chrome updates (~monthly)
   - ChromeDriver version sync issues
   - Runtime memory: 150-200MB per instance

2. **Dual Scraper Burden**
   - Lamudi breaks ‚Üí 2-3 hours fix
   - Carousell breaks ‚Üí 2-3 hours fix
   - Estimated maintenance: 16 hours/year

3. **Deployment Complexity**
   - Render free tier: 512MB limit
   - Selenium + Chrome: ~200-250MB
   - Tight margin, potential crashes
   - May force upgrade to $7/month tier

4. **Timeline Impact**
   - Current: Week 3 demo-ready
   - With Carousell: Delayed to Week 4
   - Violates stated demo goal

**Risk Analysis:**

| Risk | Probability | Impact |
|------|------------|--------|
| **Deployment failure** | 60% | Blocks integration |
| **Scraper breaks immediately** | 40% | Wasted dev time |
| **Demo timeline slips** | 100% | Week 3 ‚Üí Week 4 |
| **Data quality issues** | 70% | Unreliable stats |

### Act 5: Simplification Strategies

**Question:** "How do we significantly simplify this?"

**Simplification #1: Stub-First Architecture** (2-3 hours)

```python
# Proves architecture without real scraping
def scrape_and_normalize(...):
    return [], []  # Empty results
    # Architecture works, add real logic later
```

**Benefits:**
- Zero deployment risk
- Can demo "multi-source" concept
- Implement real scraping after validation
- 100 lines vs 390 lines

**Simplification #2: Feature Flag**

```python
ENABLE_CAROUSELL = os.getenv("ENABLE_CAROUSELL", "false")

if ENABLE_CAROUSELL:
    # Scrape Carousell
else:
    # Skip Carousell
```

**Benefits:**
- Instant rollback (env var change)
- Progressive delivery
- Test on staging first
- Zero redeployment needed

**Simplification #3: Test Requests First** (30 min validation)

```python
# Quick test to see if Selenium is even needed
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

response = requests.get('https://www.carousell.ph/property-apartments-condos-for-sale/')
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
properties = soup.find_all('a', href=lambda x: x and '/property/' in x)

if len(properties) > 0:
    print("‚úÖ Requests works! No Selenium needed!")
else:
    print("‚ùå Needs Selenium (JS-rendered)")
```

**Outcomes:**
- If requests works: 2-3 days implementation (LOW complexity)
- If Selenium needed: 5-6 days implementation (HIGH complexity)
- Know in 30 minutes which path you're on

**Simplification #4: External Service Option**

Use ScraperAPI or similar service:
- They handle Selenium/Chrome
- They handle proxies/CAPTCHA
- You just parse HTML they return
- Cost: ~$0.001 per request = $0.05 per CMA
- **Trade money for complexity reduction**

**Simplification #5: Copy Existing Patterns**

```python
# Just copy-paste and modify
psgc_mapper.py ‚Üí carousell_mapper.py
lamudi_adapter.py ‚Üí carousell_adapter.py
lamudi_scraper.py ‚Üí carousell_scraper.py
```

**Benefits:**
- Architectural consistency
- Familiar patterns
- Easy to maintain

**Reduced Timeline:** 3-4 days instead of 5-6 days

---

### Act 6: The "Real Data" Clarification

**User Concern:** "Will the stub approach scrape REAL properties? I don't want to wait."

**Clarification:** ‚ùå **NO - Stub returns empty results**

The stub approach is architectural proof only:
```python
def scrape_and_normalize(...):
    print("Carousell stub called")
    return [], []  # No actual data
```

**What User Actually Wants:**
- ‚úÖ LOW complexity
- ‚úÖ Can build right away
- ‚úÖ Gets REAL Carousell data (not stubs)

**The Disconnect:**
- Stub = 0 risk, 0 data
- Real scraper = uncertain risk, real data
- User wants real data NOW

**Proposed Solution:**
"Test if requests works (30 min), then build real scraper if it does"

---

### Act 7: Full Implementation Proposal

**User Request:** "Give me a low complexity approach I can build right away"

**What Was Provided:** Complete 4-file implementation

#### File 1: `backend/src/scraper/carousell_scraper.py` (~200 lines)

**Approach:** Optimistic requests-based scraper

```python
def scraper(location, property_type, num):
    """
    Scrapes Carousell for properties using requests + BeautifulSoup
    NO Selenium - tries simplest approach first
    """
    # Map property types
    type_map = {
        'condo': 'apartments-condos',
        'house': 'house-and-lot',
    }
    
    # Build URL
    search_url = f'https://www.carousell.ph/property-{type}-for-sale/q-{location}/'
    
    # Fetch with requests
    response = requests.get(search_url, headers=headers, timeout=15)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
    
    # Try multiple selector strategies
    # Strategy 1: article tags (React apps)
    articles = soup.find_all('article')
    
    # Strategy 2: property links
    property_links = soup.find_all('a', href=lambda x: x and '/property/' in x)
    
    # Strategy 3: price indicators
    price_elements = soup.find_all(text=re.compile(r'PHP|‚Ç±'))
    
    # Extract property URLs
    for link in property_links:
        # Collect property detail page URLs
        
    # Visit each detail page
    for url in property_urls:
        # Extract: title, price, location, beds, baths, sqm
        # Using regex and BeautifulSoup
```

**Key Features:**
- Multiple selector strategies (fallbacks)
- Regex-based data extraction
- Polite delays (0.5-1.0s between requests)
- CSV output for diagnostics
- Early detection if JS-rendering needed

**Limitations:**
- Selectors are GUESSES (haven't seen actual HTML)
- May return 0 properties if structure is different
- No guarantee regex patterns will match

#### File 2: `backend/src/adapters/carousell_adapter.py` (~100 lines)

**Approach:** Copy Lamudi adapter pattern exactly

```python
def scrape_and_normalize(location, property_type, count):
    """
    Execute Carousell scraper and normalize to canonical format
    EXACT same pattern as lamudi_adapter.py
    """
    staging_df = carousell_scraper(location, property_type, count)
    
    if staging_df.empty:
        return [], []
    
    # Normalize rows to canonical format
    for row in staging_df:
        normalized = {
            'source': 'carousell',
            'property_id': row['SKU'],
            'address': row['Location'],
            'price': float(row['TCP']),
            'bedrooms': int(row['Bedrooms']),
            'bathrooms': int(row['Baths']),
            'sqm': float(row['Floor_Area']),
            'property_type': property_type,
            'coordinates': None,  # Carousell doesn't provide
            'url': row['Source'],
        }
        properties.append(normalized)
    
    return properties, price_series
```

**Benefits:**
- Follows proven pattern
- Type coercion built-in
- Error handling
- Structured logging

#### File 3: `backend/carousell_mapper.py` (~30 lines)

**Approach:** Copy psgc_mapper.py exactly

```python
_PSGC_TO_CAROUSELL = {
    "1376": "metro-manila",
    "3400": "cavite",
    "4000": "laguna",
}

def to_carousell_location(psgc_code):
    return _PSGC_TO_CAROUSELL.get(psgc_code)
```

#### File 4: `backend/app.py` modifications (~60 lines)

**Approach:** Dual-source scraping with graceful fallback

```python
# Add imports
import carousell_mapper
from src.adapters import carousell_adapter

# Add feature flag
ENABLE_CAROUSELL = os.getenv("ENABLE_CAROUSELL", "true")

# In /api/cma endpoint:
# Scrape Lamudi (primary)
lamudi_properties, lamudi_prices = scrape_and_normalize(province, type, count)

# Scrape Carousell (optional)
if ENABLE_CAROUSELL:
    carousell_properties, carousell_prices = carousell_adapter.scrape_and_normalize(
        carousell_location, type, count
    )

# Merge results
all_properties = lamudi_properties + carousell_properties
all_prices = lamudi_prices + carousell_prices

# Calculate combined stats
stats = calculate_stats(all_prices)

# Return with source attribution
return {
    "properties": all_properties,
    "stats": stats,
    "sources": {
        "lamudi": len(lamudi_properties),
        "carousell": len(carousell_properties)
    }
}
```

**Total Implementation:**
- **Lines of code:** 390 new lines
- **Time estimate:** 3-4 hours
- **Complexity:** LOW-MEDIUM (if requests works)
- **Risk:** 60% chance requests fails ‚Üí needs Selenium

---

### Act 8: GitHub Repo Analysis

**Question:** "Should we use the CarousellWebScraper GitHub repo?"

**Repo Details:**
- **URL:** https://github.com/albertleng/CarousellWebScraper
- **Purpose:** Scrape consumer goods (baby chairs example)
- **Tech:** Selenium + ChromeDriver + BeautifulSoup
- **Target:** sg.carousell.com (Singapore)
- **Pattern:** Class-based OOP with helper methods
- **Output:** CSV files

**Analysis: ‚ùå DON'T USE IT**

**Reasons:**

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| **Geographic mismatch** | sg.carousell.com ‚â† carousell.ph |
| **Tech stack mismatch** | Selenium + classes ‚â† your requests + functions |
| **Domain mismatch** | Consumer goods ‚â† real estate properties |
| **Pattern mismatch** | Class-based OOP ‚â† your adapter pattern |
| **Complexity** | Adds Selenium when you're trying to stay lean |

**Time Comparison:**
- Adapting GitHub repo: 2 days (rewriting for Philippines, real estate, your patterns)
- Building from scratch: 3-4 hours (clean, fits your architecture)

**Recommendation:** Build your own following YOUR Lamudi pattern

**What to Reference from Repo:**
- ‚úÖ URL structure patterns
- ‚úÖ Search parameter ideas
- ‚ùå Don't copy the actual code

---

### Act 9: Critical Self-Analysis

**User Request:** "Critically analyze YOUR proposed solution with second-order thinking"

**My Honest Assessment:**

#### Intended Consequences ‚úÖ

1. Multi-source CMA (if it works)
2. More comprehensive data (if it works)
3. Architectural consistency (yes, follows Lamudi)
4. No Selenium complexity (if requests works)

#### Unintended Consequences ‚ö†Ô∏è

**1. Violates Your Core Principles** üî¥

From PIVOTS-MADE.md:
```
Line 23: "Validates product-market fit first"
Line 25: "Can add complexity later if proven valuable"
Lesson: ‚úÖ "Validate with real users fast"
Lesson: ‚ùå "Don't build sophisticated features before validation"
```

My solution:
```
‚ùå Adds 390 lines BEFORE validation
‚ùå Adds complexity NOW, not "later if proven"
‚ùå Goes beyond "validation essentials"
‚ùå Delays Week 3 demo goal
```

**2. Premature Optimization** üî¥

Current state:
- Week 3, demo-ready with Lamudi
- Lamudi proves the CMA concept
- 31 properties, working stats
- Users haven't been asked yet

My proposal:
- Build Carousell BEFORE demos
- Add 390 lines on speculation
- Risk 3-4 hours on 30-40% chance
- Build feature with unknown demand

**3. High Technical Uncertainty** ‚ö†Ô∏è

For my solution to work, ALL must be true:
```
Step 1: Carousell.ph serves HTML (40% chance) ‚ùì
  ‚Üì
Step 2: My guessed selectors work (50% chance) ‚ùì
  ‚Üì
Step 3: Data extractable via regex (60% chance) ‚ùì
  ‚Üì
Step 4: No bot detection (70% chance) ‚ùì
  ‚Üì
Step 5: Users actually want it (unknown) ‚ùì

Combined probability: 0.40 √ó 0.50 √ó 0.60 √ó 0.70 = 8.4% works first try
With debugging: 30-40% eventual success
```

**4. Time Waste Risk Scenarios** üî¥

**Scenario A: Requests Fails** (40% chance)
```
Hour 1-3: Build scraper
Hour 4: Test... 0 properties (JS-rendered)
Result: Carousell needs Selenium
Decision: Stop (3-4 hrs wasted) or continue (5 more days)?
```

**Scenario B: Works But Users Don't Care** (20% chance)
```
Week 3: Build Carousell (3-4 hours)
Week 4: Demo to companies
Feedback: "Carousell has spam/FSBO junk, we only trust Lamudi"
Result: Maintain unused feature indefinitely
Cost: 3-4 hours + ~6 hours/year maintenance
```

**Scenario C: Success** (30% chance)
```
Hour 1-4: Build scraper
Test: Works! 15 properties
Demo: Users love the extra data
Result: Win (but lucky)
```

**Scenario D: Selector Debugging Hell** (30% chance)
```
Hour 1-3: Build scraper
Hour 4: Test... finds properties but extracts garbage
Hour 5-8: Debug selectors, inspect HTML, fix regex
Hour 9: Still not working correctly
Result: 6-8 hours, questionable data quality
```

**5. Long-Term Cost** üí∞

Even if it works:
- Quarter 1: 6 hours (initial bug fixes)
- Quarter 2: 4 hours (selector updates)
- Quarter 3: 4 hours (dependency updates)
- Quarter 4: 6 hours (Carousell redesign)
- **Total Year 1:** ~20 hours maintenance

**6. Opportunity Cost** üí∏

3-4 hours could be spent on:
- ‚úÖ PDF export (users likely want this)
- ‚úÖ More provinces (expand coverage)
- ‚úÖ PropertyGuru integration (professional source)
- ‚úÖ Historical trends (add value)
- ‚úÖ Polish existing UX

**7. Sunk Cost Fallacy Trap** üé£

```
Hour 3: Discover requests doesn't work
Mental state: "I already spent 3 hours..."
Temptation: "Might as well try Selenium"
5 days later: Selenium working
Demo feedback: "We don't use Carousell data"
Total waste: 8 days on unvalidated feature
```

---

### Act 10: Final Assessment

**Question:** "Is complexity high and chances of success low?"

**My Honest Answer:**

| Metric | Assessment |
|--------|-----------|
| **Code complexity** | LOW-MEDIUM ‚≠ê‚≠ê (if it works) |
| **Technical success chance** | 30-40% ‚ö†Ô∏è |
| **User value success chance** | Unknown (unvalidated) |
| **Combined success chance** | 15-25% üî¥ |
| **Time at risk** | 3-4 hours minimum |
| **Potential waste** | 3-8 hours depending on path |

**The Real Issue:** Not complexity, it's **UNCERTAINTY + PREMATURE OPTIMIZATION**

#### What We DON'T Know ‚ùì

1. Does Carousell.ph serve server-side HTML?
2. Are my guessed selectors correct?
3. Does Carousell have bot detection?
4. Do users want Carousell data?
5. Is Carousell data quality good enough for CMA?
6. Do users trust FSBO listings?

#### What We DO Know ‚úÖ

1. Lamudi works (proven in production)
2. Your adapter pattern works (proven)
3. You can demo Week 3 with Lamudi alone
4. Lamudi alone validates the CMA concept
5. Users will tell you what they want if you ask

#### Risk/Reward Analysis üìä

**Best Case** (30% chance):
- 4 hours work ‚Üí Working scraper
- 31 Lamudi + 15 Carousell = 46 properties
- More impressive demo
- **Reward:** Better demo (if users care)

**Likely Case** (40% chance):
- 4-8 hours work ‚Üí Realizes needs Selenium
- Give up or commit 5 more days
- Demo delayed Week 3 ‚Üí Week 4
- **Cost:** 4-8 hours + timeline slip

**Worst Case** (30% chance):
- 4 hours work ‚Üí Working perfectly
- Users: "We don't trust Carousell data"
- Maintain unused feature forever
- **Cost:** 4 hours + 20 hours/year maintenance

## üéØ KEY INSIGHTS

### Insight #1: The Mind-Change Arc

```
Position 1: "Don't add Carousell - wrong domain!"
  ‚Üì (User shows property screenshots)
Position 2: "You're right, it's valuable!"
  ‚Üì (Apply second-order thinking)
Position 3: "Don't add it YET - validate first"
```

### Insight #2: Complexity vs Uncertainty

**The code itself:** LOW-MEDIUM complexity  
**The problem:** Building on 30-40% technical chance + unknown user demand

**Bad bet formula:**
```
Risk = (Time Investment) √ó (1 - Success Probability) √ó (User Want Probability)
Risk = 4 hours √ó (1 - 0.35) √ó (0.50 unknown)
Risk = 4 hours √ó 0.65 √ó 0.50
Risk = 1.3 expected hours wasted

But timeline delay + maintenance adds more risk
```

### Insight #3: Your Docs Have The Answer

From PIVOTS-MADE.md:
> "Ship minimal ‚Üí Learn ‚Üí Add what users want"

You haven't learned what users want yet.

**Question to ask:** "Am I building what users want or what I think is cool?"

### Insight #4: Simplest ‚â† Smallest Code

**My solution:** 390 lines in 3-4 hours  
**Truly simple:** 0 lines, demo Lamudi, ask users, then build

**Lean development:** Validated work, not minimal code

### Insight #5: Second-Order Consequences

**First-order thinking:**
- "More data sources = better product!"
- "Carousell has properties!"
- "Let's add it!"

**Second-order thinking:**
- "Do users want this?"
- "What if it doesn't work?"
- "What else could I build instead?"
- "What's the opportunity cost?"
- "Am I following my own principles?"

## ‚úÖ FINAL RECOMMENDATION

### DON'T Build Carousell Now

**Reasons:**

1. **Violates validation-first principles** (your PIVOTS-MADE.md)
2. **30-40% technical success probability** (requests might not work)
3. **Unknown user demand** (haven't asked yet)
4. **Delays Week 3 demo** (adds 3-4 hours minimum)
5. **390 lines of speculative code** (might be wasted)
6. **Premature optimization** (Lamudi alone proves concept)

### DO This Instead

#### This Week (Week 3):
```
1. ‚úÖ Polish Lamudi UI/UX
2. ‚úÖ Prepare demo materials
3. ‚úÖ Practice demo
4. ‚úÖ Demo to 3 companies
5. ‚úÖ Gather feedback
```

#### During Demos, Ask:
```
1. "Would additional data sources improve this for you?"
2. "Which property sources do you trust most?"
3. "Do you use FSBO/Carousell listings in your analysis?"
4. "What features would make this more valuable?"
```

#### Next Week (Week 4):

**IF users say "We need Carousell specifically":**
```
1. Test if requests works (30 min)
2. If YES: Build following Lamudi pattern (3-4 hours)
3. If NO: Evaluate if Selenium worth 5-6 days
4. Deploy with feature flag
```

**IF users say something else:**
```
1. Build what they actually requested
2. Prioritize based on feedback
3. Stay lean, stay validated
4. Consider Carousell later if still relevant
```

**IF users say "Lamudi is enough":**
```
1. Don't build Carousell at all
2. Focus on polish and other features
3. You saved 3-4 hours + maintenance burden
4. Made the right call by asking first
```

## üìä PROBABILITY OUTCOMES

| Outcome | Probability | Result |
|---------|------------|--------|
| **Build now, works, users want it** | 12% | Lucky win ‚úÖ |
| **Build now, works, users don't care** | 18% | 4 hrs wasted |
| **Build now, requests fails** | 40% | 3-4 hrs wasted |
| **Build now, selectors wrong** | 30% | 6-8 hrs wasted |
| **Demo first, users want, then build** | 100% validated | Smart ‚úÖ |
| **Demo first, users want other features** | 100% validated | Build right thing ‚úÖ |
| **Demo first, users satisfied with Lamudi** | 100% validated | Saved time ‚úÖ |

**Expected value of "build now":** -1.5 hours (net negative)  
**Expected value of "demo first":** 100% validated decisions (positive)

## üéì META-LESSONS

### What This Analysis Taught

1. **Technical enthusiasm ‚â† Strategic wisdom**
   - I got excited about solving the technical problem
   - Ignored the strategic principle of validation
   - Your instinct to question was correct

2. **Sometimes best code is code you don't write**
   - 390 lines now vs 0 lines until validated
   - Not all features add value
   - Restraint is a skill

3. **Your documentation already had the answer**
   - PIVOTS-MADE.md is your north star
   - When in doubt, refer to your principles
   - "Ship minimal ‚Üí Learn ‚Üí Add what users want"

4. **Second-order thinking reveals hidden costs**
   - First look: "Only 3-4 hours"
   - Deeper look: Timeline delay + maintenance + opportunity cost
   - Real cost: 8-20 hours over first year

5. **Validation isn't just about users wanting a feature**
   - Also validates: Technical approach
   - Also validates: Priority vs other features
   - Also validates: Worth the maintenance burden

## üìù ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY

**"We explored adding Carousell to your CMA tool, went from 'hell no' to 'maybe yes' to 'not yet‚Äîvalidate first', and concluded that your PIVOTS-MADE.md principle of 'demo first, learn what users want, then build' is the right path forward."**

## üìö REFERENCE DOCUMENTS

- **PIVOTS-MADE.md** - Your guiding principles (follow these!)
- **DATA-SCRAPING-LAMUDI.md** - Proven Lamudi implementation
- **BACKEND-FRONTEND-INTEGRATION.md** - Integration patterns
- **KAIROS-GUARDRAILS.md** - Development constraints

**Key Principle to Remember:**
> "Make it work, make it right, make it fast" (in that order)
> "Build the telescope before planning which stars to observe"

Your Week 3 demo with Lamudi alone is the telescope. Build that first. üî≠
